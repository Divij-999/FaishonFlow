# ReWear
ReWear is a full-stack Django + React app that enables users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based system. It promotes sustainable fashion and reduces textile waste by encouraging community reuse. Users can list items, earn points, request swaps, and manage their wardrobe online.
